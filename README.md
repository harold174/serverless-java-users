# Java serverless users example + AWS Lambda + API Gateway

The same configuration as its sibling project [Java serverless movies example](https://github.com/harold174/serverless-java-movies)

Notice that both projects have the same serverless.yml provider configuration

```
provider:
  apiGateway:
    restApiId: XXXXXX # REST API resource ID. Default is generated by the framework
    restApiRootResourceId: XXXXXX # Root resource, represent as / path
```
